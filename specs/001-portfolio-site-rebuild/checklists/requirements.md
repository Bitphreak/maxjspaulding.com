**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-08

- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW |
| Requirement Completeness | PASS | All requirements testable, no clarification needed |
| Feature Readiness | PASS | Ready for planning phase |

## Notes

- Spec is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Content dependencies (bio, experience, projects) noted but don't block specification
- LinkedIn data partially obscured; final content will come from user during implementation
- Design system fully documented in existing style guide (docs/styleguide.md)
